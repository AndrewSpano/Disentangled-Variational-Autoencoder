# Disentangled Variational Autoencoder

PyTorch Implementation of the papers
- [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)
- [beta-VAE: Learning Basic Visual Concepts with a Constrained Variational Framework](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl)
<br> </br>


## Structure of Repo

- The directory [src/models](src/models) contains the models we have created so far. More are coming along the way.
- The python script [src/main.py](src/main.py) is used for training and testing.
- In the [mathematical_analysis](mathematical_analysis) directory there is a [pdf](mathematical_analysis/vae_maths.pdf) where the basic mathematical concepts of the Variational Autoencoder are explained thoroughly.
- In the [config](config) directory there are some configuration files that can be used to create the models.
